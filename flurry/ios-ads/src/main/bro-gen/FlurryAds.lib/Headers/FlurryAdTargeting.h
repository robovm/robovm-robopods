 *  Use information from the CLLocationManager to specify the location for Ad Targeting. Flurry does not
 *  automatically track this information or include the CLLocation framework.
 *
 *  @note The location information set here is not persisted on the user's device.
 *  Regardless of accuracy specified, the Flurry SDK will only report location at city level or higher.
 *  Location is aggregated across all users of your app and not available on a per user basis.
 *  This information should only be captured if it is germaine to the use of your app.
 *
 *  @code
 
    CLLocationManager *locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];
    [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];
 
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  After starting the location manager, you can set the location with FlurryAdTargeting. You can implement
 *  CLLocationManagerDelegate to be aware of when the location is updated. Below is an example
 *  of how to use this method, after you have recieved a location update from the locationManager.
 *
 *  @code
    -(void) locationManager: (CLLocationManager *)locationManager 
        didUpdateToLocation: (CLLocation *) newLocation
    {
        FlurryAdTargeting* adTargeting = [FlurryAdTargeting targeting];
        adTargeting.location = locationManager.location;
    }

 *  UserCookies allow the developer to specify information on a user executing an ad action. On each ad click the UserCookies are transmitted to the Flurry servers. The UserCookie key/value pairs will be transmitted back to the developer via the app callback if one is set. This is useful for rewarded inventory, to identify which of your users should be rewarded when a reward callback is sent.
